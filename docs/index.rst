Welcome to Oras Python!

OCI Registry as Storage enables client libraries to push OCI Artifacts to `OCI Conformant <https://github.com/opencontainers/oci-conformance>`_ registries. This is a Python client for that.

.. code-block:: console

    # install the client
    $ pip install  oras

    # Login to an OCI registry
    $ oras-py login -u myuser -p mypass localhost:5000

    # Prepare an artifact!
    echo "hello dinosaur" > artifact.txt

    # Push it..
    $ oras-py push localhost:5000/dinosaur/artifact:v1 \
    --manifest-config /dev/null:application/vnd.acme.rocket.config \
    ./artifact.txt
    Successfully pushed localhost:5000/dinosaur/artifact:v1

    # And pull again
    $ rm -f artifact.txt # first delete the file
    $ oras-py pull localhost:5000/dinosaur/artifact:v1
