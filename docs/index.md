Welcome to Oras Python!

OCI Registry as Storage enables client libraries to push OCI Artifacts
to [OCI Conformant](https://github.com/opencontainers/oci-conformance)
registries. This is a Python client for that.

``` console
# Install the client
$ pip install  oras

# Login to an OCI registry
$ oras-py login -u myuser -p mypass localhost:5000

# Prepare an artifact!
echo "hello dinosaur" > artifact.txt

# Push it..
$ oras-py push localhost:5000/dinosaur/artifact:v1 \
--manifest-config /dev/null:application/vnd.acme.rocket.config \
./artifact.txt
Successfully pushed localhost:5000/dinosaur/artifact:v1

# And pull again
$ rm -f artifact.txt # first delete the file
$ oras-py pull localhost:5000/dinosaur/artifact:v1
```
